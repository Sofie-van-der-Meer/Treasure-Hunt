# SCHOOL PROJECT - TREASURE HUNT
As part of completing my JavaScript course, I created this fun little game featuring an adventurous fox.

## About The Project
In this exciting treasure hunt game, a little fox embarks on a thrilling quest to uncover hidden, yummy treasures. Players can choose from three different levels and go hunting while avoiding the mother fox, who is trying to catch the little fox.

**Key Features:**

- [x] **Play Area:** The entire play area is built using Three.js. The terrain, grass, stones, and treasures are created with 3D meshes. The fox models are imported and can be found [here](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets/tree/main/Models/Fox).
- [x] **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):** The project follows an object-oriented structure based on [Bruno Simon](https://github.com/brunosimon)'s lesson on "Code Structuring for Bigger Projects."
- [x] **Fullscreen & Responsive Design:** The game works seamlessly on both larger screens with keyboard events and smaller screens with virtual keyboard buttons. Upon loading the website, a fullscreen button is available to enhance the gameplay experience. Additionally, the game is best enjoyed in landscape orientation, so a pop-up is shown to tip the user to rotate the device.
